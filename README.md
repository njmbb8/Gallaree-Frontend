# Shai Prince's Front-End for their portfolio website

This repo is the code for the a website that I had initially started developing for an artist friend, but will be expanding into a side hustle once finished. The whole idea is to make the process behind selling your art online to be as simple as possible: sign up, upload some art and then sell it.


## Currently Implemented

- User Registration and sign in/sign out
- View, edit, upload and delete art(only if you are signed in, of course)
- Ability to communicate with a back end api without CORS issues
- Order multiple items at once using a custom cart and checkout page 
- Stripe integration for processing payments
- Blog with Comments
- An about page for the artist to describe themselves

## To Do

- Messaging to communicate with the artist
- Socket.io integration to keep front and backends synchronized(Instant messaging, automatically updating quantity available, etc.)
-
