# Shai Prince's Front-End for their portfolio website

This repo is the code for the front end of Shai Prince's professional artist portfolio. While this repo is in its very early stages, this project will eventually be a one stop shop for all things Shai Prince when it comes to art.

This site was written in React, using react-bootstrap(among many other libraries, viewable in package-lock.json) to create a intuitive, reactive, mobile friendly user experience that is pleasing to the eye and provides a positive user experience and generates sales.


## Currently Implemented

- User Registration and sign in/sign out
- View, edit, upload and delete art(only if you are signed in, of course)
- Ability to communicate with a back end api without CORS issues

## To Do

- Social media integration(Uploading an artpiece makes an announcement on the blog section as well as any attached social media platforms)
- User profile displayed in an editable form
- Cart and checkout with integration to a payment system such as stripe
- Different access to different features for customer, artist, signed out, etc.
